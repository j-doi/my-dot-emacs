* General

  - [X] org-mode
  - [X] set ~/.emacs.d/url/cookies to `private`
  - [ ] why emacs create temporary files in `site-start.d`. for example, #init_cpp.el#
  - [ ] `package-list-packages` generates ".smex-items" and "places". Fix it.
  - [ ] spell check, for latex or org-mode
  - [ ] fix "setenv" for all platform. Especially on windows.
  - [ ] filladapt.el :: it seems a old package. try it later
  - [ ] skeleton mode
  - [X] color-theme library from "/vendor/color-theme-6.6.0"
  - [ ] offline backup all package from elpa and marmalade
  - [X] how to write a "package" instead of a single .el file?
  - [ ] japanese-holidays.el was not encoded in UTF-8.

* Linux
