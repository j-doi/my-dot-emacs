;; To delete whitespace from point to next word:
(defun whack-whitespace (arg)
  "Delete all white space from point to the next word.  With prefix ARG
    delete across newlines as well.  The only danger in this is that you
    don't have to actually be at the end of a word to make it work.  It
    skips over to the next whitespace and then whacks it all to the next
    word."
  (interactive "P")
  (let ((regexp (if arg "[ \t\n]+" "[ \t]+")))
    (re-search-forward regexp nil t)
    (replace-match "" nil nil)))

;; To delete adjacent whitespace forward:
(defun delete-horizontal-space-forward () ; adapted from `delete-horizontal-space'
  "*Delete all spaces and tabs after point."
  (interactive "*")
  (delete-region (point) (progn (skip-chars-forward " \t") (point))))

;; Backward:
(defun backward-delete-char-hungry (arg &optional killp)
  "*Delete characters backward in \"hungry\" mode.
    See the documentation of `backward-delete-char-untabify' and
    `backward-delete-char-untabify-method' for details."
  (interactive "*p\nP")
  (let ((backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry))
